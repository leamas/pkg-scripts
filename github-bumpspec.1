.SH NAME
github-bumpspec \- Update spec file release and changelog from git data.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B github-bumpspec [options] <spec-file> >new-file.spec

.SH DESCRIPTION
A script which simplifies spec file managament when applying the Fedora
Packaging Guidelines to github projects.
.PP
The script synchronizes two parts of the spec: The top line with
.I %global commit 0123456789...
and the changelog.
.PP
For the %global statement, the value is patched to match the full
40-character HEAD commit.
.PP
For the changelog, any reference to a 7-character short commit is updated
to match HEAD. By default the script updates the existing, topmost entry
but using -n it can instead add a new one which also bumbs the release
number.
.PP
Script must be invoked in a directory with valid git data.
