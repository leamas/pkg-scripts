.TH gitspec" 1
.SH NAME
gitspec \- Update rpmbuild spec file using git data.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gitspec [options] <spec-file> >new-file.spec
.br
.B gitspec -i [options] <spec-file>
.br
.B gitspec -l <spec-file>

.SH DESCRIPTION
Simplifies spec file managament when applying the Fedora
Packaging Guidelines to git-based projects. One basic idea is that it
should be possible to enter change data in one place instead of
duplicating it in both git commits and the specfile changelog.

The script is modeled after the "Packaging github source URL" section,
although this dependency is not that hard.
.PP
The script synchronizes three parts of a spec with the git repo: The
top line with %global commit definition, the Version: tag and the changelog.

The Version: tag is only updated when using -v, see OPTIONS.
.SH THE %commit DEFINITION.
The script looks for a line like:
.IP "" 4
    %global commit   0123456789abcde0123456789abcdeff01234567
.PP
In this line, the full 40-character commit is patched to match HEAD. If no such
line is found it's silently ignored.
.SH THE CHANGELOG
Most changelog options works on the topmost (i. e., latest) entry. The -n
option adds a new entry.
.PP
A typical changelog entry looks like:
.IP "" 4
* Thu Oct 10 2013 User name <email@nowhere.net> - 0.9-15.fa1afe1
.PP
In this entry, any commit reference ('fa1afe1') above  is replaced with the
value from HEAD. The date is rewritten as today's date, or the -d option.
.PP
Besides the entry, the script can also add change lines based on the git
commits to the topmost entry.
Using -l the change lines can be previewed, using -L actually adds those
lines to the specfile. A typical set of change lines looks like:
.IP "" 4
- Add -l create changelog option, new default comment.
.br
- Add -L insert changelog from git commits option.
.br
- Adding -x option clear last changelog entry.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
-g:
Only substitute %global commmit line, don't update changelog.
.TP
-c <comment>:
Add comment line to changelog, defaults to last git commit (subject line)
when adding a new entry.
.TP
-d <date>:
Date to use in changelog instead of today's date.
.TP
-l:
Make list of changes formatted for a changelog entry based on git log.
Includes logs after previous changelog entry. The list is based on
the git commit subject lines with a leading '- '.
.TP
-L:
Insert the list of changes based on git commits as of -l in topmost changelog
entry.
.TP
-n:
Create new changelog entry and release instead of patching last one.
Bumps the release number i.  e., the first digit(s) before a '.' in the
release. A release like 1.fa1afe1 is bumped to 2.123cdef, 1.200.fa1afe1
becomes 2.200.123cdef. Implies -c. User name and email is taken from
git configuration user.name and user.email.
.TP
-v:
Update Version: in spec from first git tag pointing to HEAD found. Fails
if no such git tag can be found.
.TP
-i:
Update spec file in place, don't print on stdout.
.TP
-x:
Clear all change lines in topmost changelog entry which becomes empty. This
is applied before other operations so -xL does indeed wipe the old and then
adds the new one.

Similar tool not based on git. It's possible to use this to bump the release
and changelog in more elaborated ways and then patch the results using
gitspec.
